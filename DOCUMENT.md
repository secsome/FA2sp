# FINALALERT2 - SP  DOCUMENT

## GETTING START
- Just like Ares, FA2sp needs Syringe to work properly, so you can just take Ares as a reference.
- What you need to know is that FA2sp requires Vanilla FinalAlert 2 1.02, any modified version may lead to unexpected errors!
- Before you launch it for the first time, write the ini files below properly, especially for essential ones (marked by **x**).
- If you still have any problem about it or something wrong occured while using it, please contact me directly or mail me at 3179369262@qq.com.
- Now you can also join Discord server https://discord.gg/k4SVuMm, and found `map-editor-patches` under `DEDICATED PROJECTS`.
- For now, I cannot ensure the stability of it, so save your maps frequently before heavy loss! XD

~~The multiple selection function is now available. Press Ctrl key to select tiles and press Ctrl+Shift key to deselect them. Ctrl+D can clear all selected tiles.
Now this feature supports RaiseSingleTile/LowerSingleTile (though they are not "Single" anymore) and calucate selected area ore value.
NOTICE THAT UNDOREDO AND COPYPASTE HASN'T BEEN SUPPORTED YET!~~

## WRITE IN THE END
- This project was developed after FA2Copy with still many bugs to fix, then Zero Fanker advised to use inline hooks instead of Win32API message hooks to implement more functions and fix more bugs, and finally we comes to FA2sp. 

- Thanks to AlexB, who gave me many suggestions and useful infomation while disassembling it. Chatting with him in the midnight because of time difference is quite interesting, too.

- Zero Fanker has made a great contribution to the setting up of this project, with many essential suggestions put forward.

- Caco did quite much test works for this project, also bringing out many problems I haven't noticed before.

- tomsons26 has made great assistance on disassembing it, REALLY HELPFUL.

- thomassneddon provided me with vxl drawing lib and drawing stuff assistence, without I cannot draw the VXL stuffs.

- btw the code of FinalAlert 2 is really in a MESSY! Full of unnecessary constructors. I HATE IT!
